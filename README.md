Sandboxie Activation Key tools

**Please note that Sandboxie Activation Key generator WILL NOT WORK since private 2048 bit RSA key required and Sophos refused to release it or any offline activation tool. Sandboxie Open Source tool now, but older version which has less bugs and Windows XP support require activation for work with the license. If you're legal Sandboxie license owner - contact Sophos and demand this RSA key or the activation tool to be released. You paid for this software and you have all the rights to use it even after discontinuance.**
